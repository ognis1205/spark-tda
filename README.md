The scalable topological data analysis package for [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). This project aims to
implement the following features:

- [x] [Scalable Mapper Implemented as Reeb Diagrams, i.e., Reeb Cosheaves]()
- [x] [Scalable Mapper Implementation]()
- [ ] Scalable Multiscale Mapper Implementation
- [ ] Scalable Tower Computation for Multiscale Mapper
- [ ] Scalable Persistent Homology Computation on Top of Apache Spark

If you would like to know how to use and/or learn more the implementation details of the above mentioned features, please follow the links.

# Status

**WIP** and **EXPERIMENTAL**. This package is still a proof-of-concept of scalable topological data analysis support for
Apache Spark, hence you cannot expect that this package is ready for production use.

# Examples

### Mapper

2-skeltons of Reeb Diagram of MNIST (40 intervals)          | 2-skeltons of Reeb Diagram of MNIST (20 intervals)

# Requirements

This library requires Spark 2.0+

# Building and Running Unit Tests

To compile this project, run `sbt package` from the project home directory. This will also run the Scala unit tests.
To run the unit tests, run `sbt test` from the project home directory. This project uses the
[sbt-spark-package](https://github.com/databricks/sbt-spark-package) plugin, which provides the 'spPublish' and
'spPublishLocal' task. We recommend users to use this library with Apache Spark including the dependencies by
supplying a comma-delimited list of Maven coordinates with `--packages` and download the package from the locally
repository or official [Spark Packages](https://spark-packages.org/) repository.

### The package can be published locally with:

```bash
$ sbt spPublishLocal
```

### The package can be published to [Spark Packages](https://spark-packages.org/) with (requires authentication and authorization):

```bash
$ sbt spPublish
```

# Using with Spark Shell

This package can be added to Spark using the `--packages` command line option. For example, to include it when starting
the spark shell:

```bash
$ spark-shell --packages ognis1205:spark-tda:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-spark2.2-s_2.11
```

# Future Works

### Mapper

- [x] Write README
- [ ] Publish to [Spark Packages](https://spark-packages.org/)
- [ ] Support CI
- [ ] Write Wiki
- [ ] Implement Python APIs
- [ ] Benchmark
- [ ] Consider using [GraphFrames](https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes) instead of plain GraphX
- [ ] Implement some useful filter functions, e.g., Gaussian Density, Graph Laplacian, etc as transformers
